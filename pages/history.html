            McCarthy's father was an Irish immigrant from the small fishing town of Cromane, Ireland. His mother was a  Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, however I could not find where she was from specificaly. McCarthy was born in Boston, Massachusettes on the fourth of September, 1927. Both of his parents were active members in the Communist Party, and were forced to relocated many times during the great depression, until his fathher found work in the Amalgamated Clothing Workers as an organiser. Before he entered high school, McCarthy gained intrest in science fiction after reading the popular russian childrens sci-fi book, "100,000 Why's". During his family's many trips to the soviet union he made friends with russian scientists, as he was fluent in russian.

            John McCarthy eventualy distanced himself from his russian companions and the comunist party after a trip to the Soviet Bloc, becoming a conservative republican in the processe. In his teens he taught himself college level math using textbooks from Caltech, a nearby college, and managed to skip the two first years of math there, but was suspended as he did not show up to physed repeatedly. He eventually recived a Bachelor of Science in mathematics after being readmitted, and went on to achive a PHD in mathematic at Princeton University in 1951.
