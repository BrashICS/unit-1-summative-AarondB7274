            Viewed as one of the "founding fathers" of A.I, along with notable figures such as Alan Turing, Allen Newell, Marvin Minsky and Herbert A. Simon. The term artifical Intelligence was coined by him, Minsky and a few others in a joint proposal written for the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Conference, which also made A.I and actual feild of development. McCarthy later proposed the "Advice Taker" program, which was likely the first program, hypothetical or not, to use logic for storing data, not only executing instructions.

            He went on to develop the LISP language, which is mainly used in A.I programs, and ALGOL60, a member of the ALGOL language family, which could recursively invoke function defenitions. He later made further contributions to ALGOL by suggesting recursive, and cconditional, expressions and was later involved in developing global programing standards as an IFIP member. McCarthy also developed "garbage collection" methods for LISP that solved problems through automatic memory management. Additionally, he was instrumental in developing time-sharing systems, which we now know as cloud computing or servers.

            Overall, his contributions heavily advanced A.I. reaserch and sped up the development of the internet through various languages and time-sharing systems that allow us to use computers on this vast of a scale in the time we have.
